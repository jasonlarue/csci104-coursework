Place cache_test.cpp and Makefile inside hw8-check inside your hw8 folder.
The Makefile should replace your current Makefile in hw8-check.
Place cacheAnalysis.cpp inside your hw8 folder, not inside hw8-check.

IMPORTANT: read the instructions inside both files.  
cacheAnalysis takes a little bit of work to set up, which is detailed inside the cpp file.

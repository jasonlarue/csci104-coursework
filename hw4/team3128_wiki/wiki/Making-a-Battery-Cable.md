**IMPORTANT:** Read the entire step before starting each step.

Tools Required:

- Ruler
- Exacto Knife/Box Cutter/Sharp Knife
- Wire Cutters/Stripper
- Hydraulic Crimp Tool
- 2 AWG and 4 AWG Crimp Tool Dies
- Heat Gun
- Scissors

## Instructions

1. Measure a 10” inch  length of cable using a *Ruler*.
2. Cut 10” of cable with Wire Cutters.
3. Measure 7/8” from the end of the 10” cable using a Ruler.
4. Use a *Sharp Knife* to **carefully** cut 1” of insulation from the end of the cable.  
**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT cut into the copper wires.
5. Carefully remove the 1” of insulation from the cable, making sure the wire stays tight. 
**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT twist the cable.
6. Carefully slide a battery terminal connector onto the exposed wire. AFTER all of the wires are partially inside the barrel, you may twist to fully seat the barrel.
7. Using the *2 AWG Dies* and the *Hydraulic Crimp Tool*, carefully crimp the barrel of the battery terminal connector twice. The dies MUST both face the same way; you should only be able to read the size of the die on one side of the tool. Do not crimp too close to either end of the barrel. Keep pumping the tool until the dies ALMOST touch. Do NOT bottom out the dies. Crimp the barrel on the side nearest the insulation first.
8. Measure 7/16” from the other end of the 10” cable using a *Ruler*.
9. Use a *Sharp Knife* to carefully cut 7/16” of insulation from the end of the cable.  
**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT cut into the copper wires.
10. Carefully remove the 7/16” of insulation from the cable, making sure the wire stays tight. 
**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT twist the cable.
11. Carefully slide an Anderson Power Pole Terminal onto the exposed wire. AFTER all of the wires are partially inside the barrel, you may twist to fully seat the barrel.  
12. Twist the terminal until the flat part is perpendicular to the flat part of the battery terminal connector.  
13. Using the *4 AWG Dies* and the *Hydraulic Crimp Tool*, carefully crimp the barrel of the battery terminal connector once. Use the same techniques as before.
Measure a 1.5” length of red shrink tubing using a *Ruler*.
14. Cut 1.5” of shrink tubing with *Scissors*.
15. Slip the 1.5” of shrink tubing onto the cable and position it so that 1” is covering the battery connector terminal barrel and the rest is covering the cable insulation.
16. Use the *Heat Gun* to shrink the tubing onto the cable and barrel.
